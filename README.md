## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
LIST OF MY FAVORITE APPLICATIONS:
TIKTOK: tiktok is one of my most favorite app because of it features such as the time limit to upload a video, also the algorithm they use to basicaly send you videos that are similar to your interest..
INSTAGRAM: I LIKE INSTAGRAM because it is more open you can sell stuff, also the adds, basically instagram is good for small to large business owners.
FACEBOOK:  they use the same features as instagram, i like because you can connect with friends and families, sell stuff, also the dating app on facebook is something that i really find interresting.

I would like to built an app that connect people all around the world, an app with easy access to conference video call , and audio call, the app will allows users to share their experiences with close families and friends just like a group chat. Posting pictures, videos... able to design 3D avatar...
